# mediation_plots
Function for plotting mediation models in R.

## What's this?

Maybe you use mediation models in your research, and want 5% prettier plots. If so, this may be for you!

Honestly, a friend asked if I knew how to make better mediation models using R, and after an hour I ended up with this function. 
It's fine. Not better than fine. I'll keep updating it over time.
